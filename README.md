#Linux Server Config

##About:
This repository (will) contains instructions for accessing a linux server I have configured for hosting web apps, along with a walkthrough, and URL to the application I deploy with it. It is a submission for Project 5 in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
